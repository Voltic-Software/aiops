# ADR-0001: aiops Initialized

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** {{.Project.Name}} initialized with aiops
**Maturity:** {{.Maturity}}

## Context

This project uses [aiops](https://github.com/voltic-software/aiops) for AI session management. The following decisions were made at initialization time and should be respected by all AI agents.

## Decision

- AI agents follow a **single-agent default** execution model
- Multi-agency is available but **gated by escalation rules**
- Architectural decisions are recorded in this `decisions/` directory
- Agents must read decisions at session start and must NOT contradict them without explicit escalation

## Adding Decisions

Create new files in this directory using the format:

```
decisions/
  0001-aiops-initialized.md
  0002-your-architecture-decision.md
  0003-your-technology-choice.md
```

Each decision should include:
- **Status**: Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded
- **Context**: Why the decision was needed
- **Decision**: What was decided
- **Consequences**: What follows from this decision

## Consequences

- All AI agents will read and respect these decisions
- Decisions cannot be overridden without escalation
- This creates organizational memory that survives across sessions and teammates
