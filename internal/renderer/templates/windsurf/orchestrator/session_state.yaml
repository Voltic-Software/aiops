# Session Coordination State
# This file is the shared blackboard for cross-session coordination.
# Any Cascade session can read and update this file.
# Sessions synchronize through state, not through direct communication.
#
# Rules:
# 1. Only update YOUR session entry — never modify another session's entry
# 2. Locks are advisory — they signal intent, not hard blocks
# 3. Expired locks should be cleaned up by the orchestrator
# 4. Always check locks before attempting fixes in shared areas

# Active sessions — each entry represents a workstream
active_sessions: []

# Area locks — advisory ownership claims over codebase areas
# Agents MUST check these before attempting fixes in locked areas
locks: []

# Completed sessions — recent history for context
completed_sessions: []

# Global notes — cross-cutting information any session should know
global_notes: []

# Directive log — tracks @directive overrides for evolution analysis
# The evolution audit reads this to detect patterns that signal rule tuning needs
